You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn the light
You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn, turn, turn on


Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
Move your body, girl, all night long
Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
You're gonna be my girl, all night long

You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn the light
You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn, turn, turn on

You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn the light
You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn, turn, turn on
